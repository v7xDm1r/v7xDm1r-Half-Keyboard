# v7xDm1r-Half-Keyboard
I'm working on a simple one handed keyboard that anyone with basic soldering skills can make. This is a prototype that I am working on prior to making a full fledged mechanical half keyboard. This github is for this project and not the full keyboard, it will have its on project page but may share code.

Parts List:
  2x 5*7 protoboards
  35x push buttons 
  35x 1n4148
  1x RP2040 zero (USB-C)
  Magnet wire
  super glue
